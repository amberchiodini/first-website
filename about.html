          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my website!</h1>
          <p> I am currently a part-time undergraduate student that is working towards a Bachelor of Science focused in 
              Biological Sciences from Northwestern University. Aside from having multiple certifications, I have a lot 
              of experience working in the field of animal care and research. I am also an active member of the Zebrafish 
              Husbandry Association and have attended meetings that cover topics ranging from zebrafish husbandry to 
              diseases and research applications. 
          </p>

          <p>
              After I earn my degree in Biological Sciences and certificate in web development, I would like to continue 
              working with zebrafish in the biomedical field by pursuing a higher degree in developmental and/or computational 
              biology where there is much needed improvement for automation and software tools for zebrafish research.
